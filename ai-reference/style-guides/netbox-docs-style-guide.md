```

## Product Naming Conventions

### Correct Product Names
- ✅ **NetBox Cloud** (not Netbox Cloud, NetBox cloud, or netbox-cloud)
- ✅ **NetBox Enterprise** (not Netbox Enterprise, NetBox enterprise)
- ✅ **NetBox Discovery** (not Netbox Discovery)
- ✅ **NetBox Assurance** (not Netbox Assurance)
- ✅ **NetBox Operator** (not Netbox Operator)
- ✅ **NetBox Labs** (company name)
- ✅ **Orb distributed agent framework** (not Orb framework)
- ✅ **Diode SDK** (not diode sdk)

### Product-Specific Terms
- ✅ **Administration Console** (NetBox Cloud's admin interface)
- ✅ **NetBox Enterprise Installer** (not NBE installer)
- ✅ **Discovery Agent** (not discovery agent)
- ✅ **Assurance workflows** (not assurance flows)
- ✅ **Operational drift** (not configuration drift - see NetBox Assurance docs)
- ✅ **Design partner program** (for NetBox Operator)

## Writing Style

### Voice and Tone
- **Active voice**: "Configure the setting" not "The setting can be configured"
- **Direct address**: Use "you" to address the reader
- **Conversational yet professional**: Helpful but authoritative
- **Outcome-focused**: Explain what the user will achieve
- **Confident**: Avoid "simply," "just," or "easy" (implies ease when it might not be)

### Headings and Structure
- Use descriptive, action-oriented headings
- Keep heading hierarchy consistent (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Use sentence case for headings: "Setting up authentication" not "Setting Up Authentication"
- Include "Overview" sections for complex topics
- Add "Prerequisites" when setup is required

### Lists and Formatting
- Use numbered lists for sequential steps
- Use bullet points for feature lists or options
- Use **bold** for UI elements: "Click the **Save** button"
- Use `code formatting` for: commands, file names, API endpoints, field names
- Use *italics* for emphasis or new terms being introduced

## Technical Writing Guidelines

### Code Examples
- Always provide complete, working examples
- Include necessary context (file paths, prerequisites)
- Test all code snippets before publishing
- Use appropriate language tags for syntax highlighting

```yaml
# Good example with context
# File: /opt/netbox/netbox/configuration.py
ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['netbox.example.com']
DEBUG = False
```

### Screenshots and Images
- Include screenshots for complex UI interactions
- Use callouts to highlight important areas
- Keep images up-to-date with current UI
- Store in `docs/images/[feature-name]/` directory
- Provide descriptive alt text for accessibility

### API Documentation
- Show both request and response examples
- Include error handling examples
- Provide curl examples where relevant
- Link to full API documentation

## Content Structure Patterns

### Feature Documentation Pattern
1. **Complete frontmatter** (tags, versions, author, etc.)
2. **Title and overview** - What the feature does
3. **Prerequisites** (if applicable)
4. **Key benefits** - Why users should care
5. **Getting started** - Basic setup
6. **Configuration details** - Advanced options
7. **Use cases** - Real-world scenarios
8. **Troubleshooting** (if applicable)
9. **Related information** - Links to other docs

### Landing Page Pattern (like NetBox Operator)
1. **Complete frontmatter** (tags, versions, author, etc.)
2. **Coming soon notice** (if applicable)
3. **Overview** - What the product does
4. **Key differentiators** - What makes it special
5. **How it works** - Architecture and components
6. **Benefits by audience** - Different user types
7. **Technical requirements**
8. **Getting started** - How to begin
9. **FAQ section**

### Integration Guide Pattern
1. **Complete frontmatter** (tags, versions, author, etc.)
2. **Overview** - What the integration provides
3. **Prerequisites** - Requirements and setup
4. **Installation steps** - Complete setup process

## Version and Release Information

### Version Formatting
- Use consistent version numbering: v1.9, v1.10, v1.11
- Include specific release dates when known
- Use "Coming [Month Year]" format for future releases

### Release Status Language
- **Current**: Available now for customers
- **Beta**: Available to design partners or limited users
- **Alpha**: In development, not yet available
- **Coming Soon**: Planned for future release with timeline

### Version-Specific Content
```markdown
!!! info "Version Information"
    This feature is available in NetBox Enterprise v1.10 and later (June 23, 2025).

!!! info "Coming Soon"
    NetBox Operator is currently in active development with design partners. 
    [Become a design partner](https://netboxlabs.com/products/netbox-operator/) 
    to shape the roadmap and gain early access.
```

### Version Compatibility Notes
When documenting features across versions:
- Clearly state minimum version requirements
- Note any version-specific differences
- Provide migration guidance for version updates
- Reference NetBox Community version compatibility

## Common Terminology

### Preferred Terms
- ✅ **Administrator** (not admin when referring to role)
- ✅ **User interface** or **UI** (not GUI)
- ✅ **Log in** (verb) / **Login** (noun)
- ✅ **Set up** (verb) / **Setup** (noun)
- ✅ **Back up** (verb) / **Backup** (noun)
- ✅ **Email** (not e-mail)
- ✅ **Username** (not user name)
- ✅ **Workflow** (not work flow)
- ✅ **Real-time** (not realtime)

### NetBox-Specific Terms
- ✅ **Source of truth** (not single source of truth)
- ✅ **Network documentation** (not network docs)
- ✅ **Infrastructure management** (not infra management)
- ✅ **Semantic map** (NetBox Operator context)
- ✅ **Agentic AI** (NetBox Operator capabilities)

## Admonitions Usage

### When to Use Each Type

```markdown
!!! info "Information"
    For general information, context, version details, or background.
    Example: Release dates, version requirements, beta status.

!!! tip "Pro Tip"
    For best practices, expert advice, or optimization suggestions.
    Example: Performance tips, recommended configurations.

!!! warning "Important"
    For critical information that could cause problems if ignored.
    Example: Breaking changes, security considerations, data loss risks.

!!! note "Note"
    For additional context, clarifications, or side information.
    Example: Alternative approaches, related considerations.

!!! example "Example"
    To introduce code examples or detailed use cases.
    Example: Configuration examples, API calls, real-world scenarios.
```

### Admonition Best Practices
- Keep admonitions concise and focused
- Use descriptive titles that explain the content
- Don't overuse - they should highlight truly important information
- Place them logically within the content flow
- Use consistent language: "Coming Soon" for unreleased features

## Link Guidelines

### Internal Links
- Use relative paths from the `docs/` directory
- Include file extensions (.md)
- Use descriptive link text (not "click here")

```markdown
# Good
[Console Access Guide](../Administration Console/console-access.md)
[NetBox Discovery Overview](../netbox-discovery/index.md)

# Bad
[Click here](../Administration Console/console-access.md) for console access
```

### External Links
- Use descriptive text that explains the destination
- Verify links are current and accessible
- Use the full site name for context

```markdown
# Good
[NetBox Community Documentation](https://docs.netbox.dev/)
[NetBox Labs Product Lifecycle](https://netboxlabs.com/product-lifecycle/)

# Bad
[Click here](https://docs.netbox.dev/)
```

## Use Case Framework

### Day 1/Day 1.5/Day 2 Pattern
Based on our NetBox Assurance documentation, use this framework for complex products:

- **Day 1**: Initial setup and population
- **Day 1.5**: Improving maturity and processes
- **Day 2**: Ongoing operations and maintenance

### Audience-Specific Benefits
Structure benefits by user type:
- **Network Engineers**: Technical capabilities and time savings
- **Operations Leaders**: Business value and team efficiency
- **Consulting Partners**: Client value and service differentiation

## Accessibility Guidelines

### Writing for Accessibility
- Use clear, simple language
- Provide alternative text for images
- Use descriptive link text
- Ensure proper heading hierarchy
- Don't rely solely on color to convey information

### Image Accessibility
```markdown
![NetBox Console Dashboard showing the main navigation menu with Discovery and Assurance sections highlighted](../images/console/console-dashboard.png)
```
