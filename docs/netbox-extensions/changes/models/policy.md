# Policies

A policy defines the conditions that must be met for a [change request](./changerequest.md) to be merged. Each policy defines one or more [rules](./policyrule.md) which assert these conditions. All rules must be met for the policy to be satisfied.

!!! note
    A policy with no rules defined will always fail.
