### Key Features

- **Branch Creation**: Create isolated copies of your NetBox data
- **Independent Modifications**: Make changes within branches without affecting main data
- **Merge Operations**: Integrate branch changes back into the main database
- **Conflict Resolution**: Handle data conflicts during merge operations
- **API Support**: Full REST API support for programmatic branch management
