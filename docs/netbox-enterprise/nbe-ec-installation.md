# NetBox Enterprise Embedded Cluster Installation

## Conventional Installation

You should be able to follow these instructions for installing the Embedded Cluster in most environments.
If you are in a more restrictive environment, see the [Advanced Installation](#advanced-installation) section below.

### Deploying the cluster

The following steps are required for an Embedded Cluster (EC) installation of NetBox Enterprise.

1. Download the deployment package and license file to your host (the `Authorization` token should be provided by NetBox Labs):

   ```
   curl https://replicated.app/embedded/netbox-enterprise/stable -H "Authorization: <provided by NetBox Labs>" -o netbox-enterprise-stable.tgz
   ```
2. Uncompress the package and launch the installation:

   ```
   tar -xvzf netbox-enterprise-unstable.tgz
   sudo ./netbox-enterprise install --license license.yaml
   ```

   Youâ€™ll be requested to create a password for the NetBox Enterprise admin console. A Kubernetes cluster will then be deployed, ready to host all the NetBox application components. The deployment of the cluster is complete with this message:

   ```{.bash .no-copy} 
   Visit the Admin Console to configure and install netbox-enterprise: http://my.netbox-enterprise.host:30000
   ```

### Deploying NetBox

Access the NetBox Enterprise admin console and configure NetBox.

Open the provided URL in a browser. A prompt will require the password created in Step 2:

![Admin Console](../images/netbox-enterprise/admin-console.png){ width="50%" }

A wizard will guide the configuration of NetBox for the environment:

![NetBox Configuration](../images/netbox-enterprise/configure-netbox-enterprise.png)

Configuration information includes:

- Built-in or external PostgreSQL:

- Built-in or external S3-Compatible object store:

- Built-in or external Redis object store:

- Advanced settings to configure plugins and SSO remote authentication, and IPv4/IPv6 compatibility:
  ![Advanced Settings](../images/netbox-enterprise/netbox-enterprise-advanced.png)

Finally, accept the terms of service by writing "ACCEPT" (case-insensitive) and you can proceed to the deployment.

![Accept TOS](../images/netbox-enterprise/netbox-enterprise-accept-tos.png)

### Finish the Deployment

Once you have accepted the terms of service and continued on to the main admin console, deployment will start.
The first deployment will take some time, as it brings up all subsystems and runs migrations to initialize the database.

![Deployment Started](../images/netbox-enterprise/netbox-enterprise-deploy.png)

The `Unavailable` status will change to `Ready` once the deployment is complete and NetBox has fully initialized:

![Deployment Ready](../images/netbox-enterprise/netbox-enterprise-ready.png)

### Verify the Deployment

Once you see `Ready`, NetBox Enterprise is fully deployed, and available on ports `80` and `443`.

## Advanced Installation

### Firewalld

If you are using Firewalld (commonly found on RHEL installations, among others), you will need to create a zone for the cluster before installing.

1. Determine any host IP addresses or networks (external or otherwise) that might need access to the cluster.
2. Create a file called `/etc/firewalld/zones/embedded-cluster.xml` with the following contents:
   ```xml
   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
   <zone target="ACCEPT">
     <short>embedded-cluster</short>
     <description>Zone for Embedded Cluster communication</description>
     <!-- HOST IP ADDRESSES GO HERE -->
     <source address="10.244.0.0/17"/>
     <source address="10.244.128.0/17"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="2380"/>
     <port protocol="udp" port="4789"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="6443"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="7443"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="9091"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="9443"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="10249"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="10250"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="10256"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="30000"/>
     <port protocol="tcp" port="22"/>
   </zone>
   ```
3. In the spot where it says `<!-- HOST IP ADDRESSES GO HERE -->`, add a `<source />` tag for each host or network you want to allow.
   For example, if your external IP is `1.2.3.4`, and you also have a private class C network `192.168.123.0`, you would add two lines:
   ```xml
   <source address="1.2.3.4/32" />
   <source address="192.168.123.0/24" />
   ```
4. Run `sudo firewall-cmd --reload` to load the zone configuration.

### SELinux

There are two steps to installing with SELinux enabled with enforcement turned on.

First, before you install the Embedded Cluster, run:
```bash
setenforce 0
```

...this will temporarily disable SELinux enforcement until you reenable it, or reboot.

Next, follow the normal instructions for [Conventional Installation](#conventional-installation) above.

Finally, run the following commands to make sure your Embedded Cluster installation is accessible with enforcement enabled:

```bash
export EC_DIR="/var/lib/embedded-cluster"
export KUBE_DIR="${EC_DIR}/k0s"

sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_var_lib_t "${EC_DIR}"
sudo restorecon -R -v "${EC_DIR}"

sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_runtime_exec_t "${KUBE_DIR}/bin/containerd.*"
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_runtime_exec_t "${KUBE_DIR}/bin/runc"
sudo restorecon -R -v "${KUBE_DIR}/bin"

sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_var_lib_t "${KUBE_DIR}/containerd(/.*)?"
sudo semanage fcontext -a -t container_ro_file_t "${KUBE_DIR}/containerd/io.containerd.snapshotter.*/snapshots(/.*)?"
sudo restorecon -R -v ${KUBE_DIR}/containerd
```
