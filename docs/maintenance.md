# Weekly NetBox Labs Platform Maintenance Window Notice

There are weekly maintenance windows for the NetBox Cloud Platform on Tuesdays and Thursdays between the hours of 3:00 - 5:00am EDT / 12:00 - 2:00am PDT / 07:00 - 09:00 UTC. 

These windows are used for routine maintenance on the infrastructure supporting the NetBox Labs Console, NetBox Cloud instances, and other cloud products and services offered by NetBox Labs. This includes applying necessary security patches and required upgrades to cloud infrastructure, and/or making other underlying infrastructure changes to increase reliability, security and performance.

Not every maintenance window will be used, and when it is used we will always try to complete the maintenance with no disruption to your service. In the case that downtime is unavoidable, you can expect the downtime to be limited to no more than a few minutes. If it is ever necessary to perform maintenance that could result in more extended downtime, we will provide ample notice and create a separate one-time maintenance window on [status.netboxlabs.com]( https://status.netboxlabs.com/). Note that the routine Tuesday/Thursday maintenance windows will not be reflected on the status page.

If you have any automation jobs running during these maintenance windows, we recommend that you ensure that they include business logic to properly handle failed requests, and/or shift them to run outside the maintenance windows.

Please donâ€™t hesitate to reach out to the [NetBox Labs Support Team](mailto:support@netboxlabs.com) if you have any questions about this or anything else regarding NetBox Cloud. We are always happy to jump on a call or chat over email to answer any of your questions.
