## Upgrade Maintenance Windows

These upgrade windows are used for patch, minor, and major upgrades to NetBox Cloud. Customers are assigned to one of these windows based on their time zone.

We will not perform upgrades during these windows without first notifying affected customers. If an upgrade is scheduled, customers will receive advance notice with details about the changes and any potential impact on their service.

## General System Maintenance Windows
There are weekly maintenance windows for the NetBox Cloud Platform on Tuesdays and Thursdays between the hours of 3:00 - 5:00am EDT / 12:00 - 2:00am PDT / 07:00 - 09:00 UTC.

These windows are designated for routine maintenance on the infrastructure supporting the NetBox Labs Console, NetBox Cloud instances, and other cloud products and services offered by NetBox Labs. This includes applying necessary security patches and making other infrastructure adjustments to enhance reliability, security, and performance.

Not every maintenance window will be utilized, and when maintenance is performed, we always strive to complete it with no disruption to your service. If downtime is unavoidable, it is expected to last only a few minutes. In the rare case that extended downtime is required, we will provide advance notice and schedule a separate one-time maintenance window on [status.netboxlabs.com]( https://status.netboxlabs.com/). Routine Tuesday/Thursday maintenance windows will not be listed on the status page.

If you have any automation jobs running during these maintenance windows, we recommend ensuring they include business logic to properly handle failed requests and/or adjusting their schedule to run outside the maintenance windows.

Please don’t hesitate to reach out to the NetBox Labs Support Team if you have any questions. We’re happy to connect via call or email to assist you.
