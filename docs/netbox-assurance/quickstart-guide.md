!!! note "NetBox Cloud Support"

This quickstart guide will help you get up and running with NetBox Assurance to control which data goes into NetBox by reviewing operational drift between your intended network state in NetBox and the actual network state.

## Prerequisites

- NetBox Enterprise installation
- NetBox Discovery configured and running (recommended)
- Network data sources (devices, controllers, or other systems)
- Appropriate permissions to configure assurance workflows and review data

## Quick Setup

1. **Access NetBox Assurance** through your NetBox interface
2. **Configure data ingestion** from NetBox Discovery or other sources via Diode SDK
3. **Review operational drift** and examine proposed change sets
4. **Apply approved changes** to NetBox or ignore deviations as needed

For detailed setup instructions, see the [NetBox Assurance overview](index.md).
