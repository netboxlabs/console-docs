# NetBox Assurance

NetBox Assurance is an add-on component for NetBox Enterprise that automatically detects when your real-world network infrastructure diverges from what's documented in NetBoxâ€”what we call "operational drift." Instead of hoping your documentation stays current, Assurance proactively identifies and helps remediate gaps between reality and your source of truth.

## What Makes NetBox Assurance Unique

**Continuous Drift Detection**: Automatically compares live network data against your NetBox documentation to identify discrepancies as they occur, not during incidents.

**Source-of-Truth Integration**: Purpose-built for NetBox's structured data model, ensuring seamless integration with your existing network documentation workflows.

**Proactive Alerting**: Surface deviations in a prioritized dashboard showing what needs your team's attention, with actionable insights for remediation.

**Audit-Ready Compliance**: Provides comprehensive audit trails and historical tracking to support regulatory requirements and change management processes.

## Business Impact

### Operational Excellence
- **Faster Incident Resolution**: Trust your documentation when you need it most during outages and troubleshooting
- **Reduced Operational Overhead**: Eliminate manual documentation verification and reconciliation processes
- **Improved Change Management**: Immediately see the impact of network changes with automated validation

### Compliance & Security
- **Enhanced Security Posture**: Detect unauthorized or non-compliant network changes in real-time
- **Audit Readiness**: Maintain detailed change tracking and compliance reporting for regulatory requirements
- **Risk Mitigation**: Prevent misconfigurations and security vulnerabilities through continuous validation

### Team Efficiency
- **Cross-Team Collaboration**: Enable better coordination between NetOps, SecOps, and DevOps teams
- **Automated Workflows**: Reduce manual effort with intelligent categorization and bulk processing capabilities
- **Scalable Operations**: Handle complex, multi-vendor environments without increasing operational burden

## Key Features

**Automated Data Ingestion**: Receives network data through NetBox Discovery agents, controller integrations, or the Diode API, with automatic processing and categorization.

**Intelligent Deviation Detection**: Smart categorization of drift types including infrastructure changes, new device discovery, and data quality issues.

**Workflow Integration**: Built-in processes for accepting updates, investigating anomalies, and bulk processing similar deviations.

**Historical Tracking**: Complete audit trails showing how your network changes over time, with status tracking and timestamps for operational accountability.

**Real-Time Dashboards**: Visual representation of network health with prioritized deviation lists and trend analysis.

**Bulk Operations**: Efficient processing of multiple similar deviations with streamlined approval workflows.

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Network data flows into NetBox Enterprise through multiple channels:
   - NetBox Discovery agents for automated network scanning
   - Controller integrations (VMware vCenter, Juniper Mist, Cisco Catalyst Center)
   - Diode API for custom integrations and legacy systems

2. **Comparison & Analysis**: Assurance continuously compares ingested data against your documented network intent in NetBox, identifying discrepancies automatically.

3. **Deviation Categorization**: Changes are intelligently categorized by type:
   - New infrastructure discovered
   - Configuration drift detected
   - Data quality inconsistencies
   - Unauthorized modifications

4. **Workflow Management**: Process deviations through structured workflows:
   - Accept & Update NetBox documentation
   - Investigate for deeper analysis
   - Archive processed items with audit trails

## Primary Use Cases

### Network Asset Management
Automatically discover and track new devices, interfaces, and connections as your network evolves, ensuring NetBox always reflects current reality.

### Compliance & Auditing
Maintain real-time visibility into network changes for regulatory compliance, with detailed audit trails and automated reporting capabilities.

### Change Validation
Verify that planned network changes are properly implemented and documented, with immediate detection of unintended modifications.

### Security Monitoring
Identify unauthorized network modifications, configuration changes, or new device additions that could represent security risks.

### Infrastructure Documentation
Keep network documentation accurate and up-to-date without manual effort, supporting operational efficiency and knowledge management.

## Integration with Existing Workflows

### NetDevOps & Automation
- Seamlessly integrates with Ansible, Terraform, and CI/CD pipelines
- Validates automated network changes in real-time
- Provides feedback loops for Infrastructure as Code workflows

### Monitoring & Observability
- Complements existing monitoring tools with configuration-level insights
- Integrates with SIEM and alerting systems through APIs
- Supports custom dashboards and reporting requirements

### ITSM & Change Management
- Provides audit trails for ITSM platforms
- Supports approval workflows and change tracking
- Enables compliance reporting for change management processes

## Who Benefits Most

### Large Enterprises
Organizations with complex, multi-vendor networks requiring continuous validation and compliance reporting.

### Service Providers
MSPs and ISPs managing diverse customer networks at scale, needing automated validation and multi-tenant visibility.

### Regulated Industries
Financial services, healthcare, and government organizations with strict compliance and auditing requirements.

### DevOps-Focused Teams
Organizations implementing network automation and Infrastructure as Code practices requiring continuous validation.

## Availability

NetBox Assurance is available as an add-on component for NetBox Enterprise starting with version 1.10. Your license file determines whether Assurance capabilities are enabled.

**For Existing NetBox Enterprise Users**: Contact [NetBox Labs](https://netboxlabs.com/contact/) to add Assurance to your deployment.

**For New Users**: NetBox Assurance is included with NetBox Enterprise subscriptions and can be enabled during installation.

**Note**: Even without an Assurance license, NetBox Enterprise includes Diode for powerful data ingestion capabilities. Assurance adds the drift detection and management layer on top of this foundation.

## Getting Started

1. **Enable Assurance**: Ensure your NetBox Enterprise license includes Assurance capabilities
2. **Configure Data Sources**: Set up NetBox Discovery agents or integrate with your network controllers
3. **Review Initial Deviations**: Process the initial set of discovered discrepancies to establish baseline
4. **Establish Workflows**: Configure team processes for handling different types of deviations
5. **Monitor & Optimize**: Use dashboards and reports to track network health and optimize processes
