    NetBox Cloud support coming early July 2025.

NetBox Assurance allows you to control which data goes into NetBox by detecting and managing "operational drift"â€”the difference between your intended network state documented in NetBox and the actual operational state of your network infrastructure.

## Key Features
- **Operational Drift Detection**: Identify differences between NetBox's intended state and actual network state
- **Data Ingestion Control**: Review and approve data before it enters NetBox, maintaining data quality
- **Seamless Integration**: Works with NetBox Discovery and supports custom integrations via the Diode SDK
- **Change Set Management**: Review proposed updates and apply them to NetBox branches or ignore as needed
- **Audit Trail**: Track all changes and decisions for compliance and operational history

## How It Works
NetBox Assurance follows a structured four-step workflow:

1. **Data Ingestion**: Network information flows in from NetBox Discovery, direct device interrogation, or other sources via the Diode SDK
2. **Analysis & Comparison**: Ingested data is analyzed against existing NetBox records to identify operational drift
3. **Deviation Review**: Review detected deviations and examine proposed change sets
4. **Action & Resolution**: Apply changes to NetBox, recalculate drift, or ignore deviations as needed

## Use Cases
- **Day 1 - Initial NetBox Population**: Control data quality while rapidly populating NetBox with discovery data
- **Day 1.5 - Improving Network Maturity**: Maintain operations while gradually improving documentation and automation processes  
- **Day 2 - Operational Excellence**: Proactively detect and resolve operational drift to maintain network reliability

## Getting Started

1. **[Quickstart Guide](quickstart-guide.md)**: Get up and running quickly with NetBox Assurance
2. **[Assurance Workflows](workflows/index.md)**: Configure drift detection and review processes
3. **[Data Ingestion](monitoring/index.md)**: Set up data sources from NetBox Discovery and other systems

## Support and Resources
