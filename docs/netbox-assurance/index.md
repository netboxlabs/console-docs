title: NetBox Assurance
---

NetBox Assurance automatically detects operational drift, allowing you to understand and address deviations swiftly and maintain a resilient infrastructure. It continuously monitors network and infrastructure, comparing your intended design against real-world infrastructure to uncover discrepancies and provide proactive remediation capabilities.

## Key Features
- **Instant Drift Detection**: Continuously compare your intended design against real-world infrastructure to uncover discrepancies
- **Proactive Issue Resolution**: Act on real-time data to remediate drift before it escalates, reducing downtime and troubleshooting delays
- **Automated Documentation**: Automatically keep your NetBox documentation aligned with operational reality, ensuring a consistent source of truth
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Provides real-time insights into network configuration changes
- **Integration Ready**: Works seamlessly with existing network and infrastructure operations investments

## How It Works
NetBox Assurance continuously monitors your network infrastructure in real-time, comparing current configurations against the intended design stored in NetBox. When operational drift is detected, the system generates alerts and provides proposed remediation steps, enabling swift resolution before issues escalate into major disruptions.

## Use Cases
- **Network Operations**: Maintain network configurations consistent with documented standards
- **Infrastructure Management**: Ensure infrastructure remains aligned with planned designs  
- **Compliance and Security**: Support compliance efforts by detecting unauthorized changes and configuration drift
- **Incident Prevention**: Identify and address deviations proactively to prevent major disruptions
- **Change Management**: Track and validate configuration changes across your infrastructure

## Documentation
- **Using the UI**: Learn how to navigate and use the [NetBox Assurance plugin interface](using-the-ui.md)
- **Additional Resources**: For development and setup information, refer to the [Diode](../netbox-extensions/diode/index.md) project documentation

## Support and Resources
- **Community Support**: Connect with the community on [Slack](https://netdev.chat/) in the `#netbox` channel
