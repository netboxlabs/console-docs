NetBox Assurance empowers organizations to continuously detect and address network drift by identifying deviations between the intended state in NetBox and the actual state of the network. It extends NetBox with automated deviation detection and corrective actions, helping teams maintain a consistent and reliable network infrastructure.

## Key Features
- **Deviation Detection**: Identify configuration drift between NetBox and the network.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Receive notifications when deviations are detected.
- **Automated Remediation**: Correct detected deviations through guided workflows.
- **Seamless Integration**: Enhance NetBox with continuous network validation and state synchronization.
- **Detailed Reports**: Generate actionable reports highlighting network consistency and detected deviations.

## How It Works
NetBox Assurance continuously compares the documented or intended network state stored in NetBox with the observed network state being provided by NetBox Discovery or other network data sources (via the Diode SDK). When deviations are detected, workflows allow resolving deviations by updating NetBox or by taking corrective actions on the network.

### Assurance Process
1. **Define Desired State**: Establish intended network configurations and baselines in NetBox.
2. **Enable Monitoring**: Set up continuous monitoring using NetBox Discovery or other discovery solutions for relevant network devices and services.
3. **Detect Deviations**: Identify differences between the desired and actual network states.
4. **Correct and Resolve**: Review deviations and apply or correct as needed.

## Requirements
- **NetBox Editions**: Available in NetBox Cloud and NetBox Enterprise editions.
- **NetBox Version**: Compatible starting with NetBox v4.1.

## Use Cases
- **Network Drift Detection**: Ensure network configurations remain consistent with the source of truth.
- **Compliance Audits**: Support compliance efforts by detecting unauthorized changes.
- **Incident Prevention**: Identify and address deviations before they cause major disruptions.

## Support and Resources
- **Documentation**: Please refer to [Diode](../netbox-extensions/diode/index.md) project documentation.
- **Support**: Please contact [support](mailto:support@netboxlabs.com).
