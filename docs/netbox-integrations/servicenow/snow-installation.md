---# Installation and Setup

## Before Starting

Before you start the installation, ensure the following requirements are met:

- **Administrative Privileges**: You must be logged in with admin privileges on both NetBox and ServiceNow instances
- **ServiceNow Version**: Washington DC or Xanadu (certified versions)
- **IntegrationHub License**: Your ServiceNow instance must be licensed for IntegrationHub Starter Pack for proper integration functionality

## Uploading and Committing the Application

Follow these steps to install the NetBox ServiceNow Integration application in your ServiceNow instance:

1. **Navigate to Retrieved Update Sets**
   - Go to **All > System Update Sets > Retrieved Update Sets**

2. **Import the Update Set**
   - Navigate to the **Related Links** section at the bottom of the list
   - Click on **Import Update Set From XML**
   - Select the **NetBox CMDB Integration** application file and click **Upload**
   - ‚è±Ô∏è *This operation may take several minutes*

3. **Preview the Update Set**
   - Once the file has uploaded, click on the **Preview** button
   - ‚è±Ô∏è *This operation may take several minutes*
   - Review and skip any conflicts

4. **Commit the Update Set**
   - After the preview is complete, click the **Commit** button
   - ‚è±Ô∏è *This operation may take several minutes*

5. **Handle Any Errors**
   - If any errors occur during commit, check the Release Notes to determine which errors can safely be ignored
   - Document any persistent errors for support escalation if needed

## Configuration Using Guided Setup

After successful installation, use the built-in Guided Setup to configure the application:

### Accessing the Guided Setup

1. Navigate to Guided Setup
   - Go to **All > NetBox > Configuration > Guided Setup**
   - Review the **Pre-checklist** and fulfill any outstanding requirements
   - Click **Get Started** when ready

## Phase 1: Plugins

The guided setup begins with ensuring required plugins are installed:

### Step 1.1: Install Basic Plugins
- Install essential plugins required for basic functionality
- These plugins are mandatory for the integration to work

### Step 1.2: Install Recommended Plugins  
- Install additional plugins that enhance functionality
- These plugins are recommended but not strictly required

üìù *Note: Plugin installation runs in the background. You don't need to wait for completion before proceeding to the next phase.*

## Phase 2: Post-Installation Setup

Complete the following configuration steps:

### Step 2.1: Create the HTTP(s) Connection Record

**Configure the primary connection to your NetBox instance:**

1. **Required Fields:**
   - **Name**: `NetBox API` ‚ö†Ô∏è *(case sensitive and must match exactly*
   - **Connection Alias**: `x_990381_netbox_cl.NetBox_API`
   - **Host**: Your NetBox instance hostname or IP address
   - **Connection URL**: `https://instanceNameOrIP` ‚ö†Ô∏è *(no trailing slash)*

2. **MID Server Configuration** (NetBox Enterprise Only):
   - Select **Use MID** if your NetBox instance is only accessible through a MID server
   - Configure MID server parameters as needed

3. **Save the Record**
   - Save the connection record
   - Mark the step as complete

### Step 2.2: (Optional) HTTP(s) Connection Setup

- This step allows you to modify connection parameters if needed later in the setup
- Return to this step if connection adjustments are required

### Step 2.3: Create Application Parameters

Configure application parameters based on your installation scenario:

**For New Installations:**
- When prompted: *"No existing NetBox parameters detected, this looks like a new install. Parameters will be created after pressing Save"*
- Press **Save** to create new parameters with default values

**For Existing Installations:**
- The system displays the number of existing parameters
- Choose whether to overwrite existing parameters with default values
- Missing parameters will be automatically recreated with default values

### Step 2.4: Setup Temporary Admin Connection to NetBox

**Establish elevated access for configuration:**

1. **Purpose and Security**
   - Creates temporary elevated privileges on your NetBox instance for automated configuration
   - This temporary channel enables ServiceNow to configure NetBox during setup
   - **Important**: The channel is automatically removed at the end of setup
   - Only low-privilege accounts remain after completion

2. **Configuration**
   - Follow on-screen instructions to establish the temporary communication channel
   - Provide temporary admin credentials for your NetBox instance

### Step 2.5: Setup ServiceNow to NetBox Credentials

**Create credentials for ServiceNow to access NetBox API:**

1. **Create API Credentials on NetBox**
   - Configure the following fields:
     - **Username**: Set appropriate username
     - **Password**: Set secure password  
     - **API Token**: Generate API token

2. **Critical API Token Requirements**
   - ‚ö†Ô∏è **MANDATORY**: The API Token MUST be a hexadecimal string of exactly 32 characters
   - Example format: `a1b2c3d4e5f67890abcdef1234567890`

3. **Troubleshooting Connection Issues**
   - If errors occur, verify:
     - API Token format (32-character hexadecimal string)
     - HTTP(s) connection record configuration (Step 2.1)
     - Temporary admin credentials (Step 2.4)

### Step 2.6: Associate Credentials

**Link credentials to the connection record:**

1. **Manual Association Required**
   - Follow on-screen instructions to manually associate the credentials created in Step 2.5
   - Link to the HTTP(s) Connection record created in Step 2.1
   - **Remember to save** before proceeding to the next step

### Step 2.7: Setup NetBox to ServiceNow Credentials

**Create credentials for NetBox to access ServiceNow API:**

1. **Create ServiceNow API Access**
   - Configure the following:
     - **Username**: Set appropriate username (modifiable)
     - **Password**: Set secure password (modifiable)
     - **API Key**: Automatically generated (do not modify)

2. **Integration Notes**
   - Credentials are stored locally and in your NetBox instance
   - ServiceNow credentials are stored in NetBox webhook headers

3. **Troubleshooting**
   - If errors occur, verify:
     - HTTP(s) connection record configuration (Step 2.1)
     - Temporary admin credentials (Step 2.4)

### Step 2.8: Test Connections

**Validate bidirectional connectivity:**

1. **Connection Testing**
   - Test ServiceNow to NetBox communication
   - Test NetBox to ServiceNow communication
   - Verify API responses and authentication

2. **Validation Steps**
   - Confirm all connection parameters are correct
   - Validate credential associations
   - Monitor for any errors or warnings

## Common Installation Issues

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|---------------|----------|
| Update Set Import Fails | File corruption or version mismatch | Re-download update set from NetBox Labs |
| Plugin Installation Errors | Missing dependencies or insufficient permissions | Verify ServiceNow admin privileges and dependency requirements |
| Connection Test Fails | Network connectivity or firewall issues | Check network configuration and firewall rules |
| API Token Rejected | Incorrect token format | Ensure API token is exactly 32 hexadecimal characters |
| Credential Association Fails | Timing or configuration issues | Retry association after verifying all previous steps |
| Temporary Admin Channel Failed | Invalid NetBox admin credentials | Verify NetBox admin credentials and permissions |
