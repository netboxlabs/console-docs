  # NetBox Operator

  **AI-powered network operations platform combining semantic infrastructure understanding with intelligent automation**

  NetBox Operator is an AI-driven network & infrastructure operations platform that combines NetBox's semantic model with your telemetry tools to automate monitoring, triage,
  and remediation.

  ## Overview

  Continuously watch, correlate, and act ‚Äì delivering always‚Äëon insight, lightning‚Äëfast incident triage, and automated workflows that erase operator toil.

  Unleash agentic AI operations in your infrastructure with NetBox as the map. NetBox Operator understands your network and eliminates gruntwork so you can move faster and do
  more.

  ## Two Product Approaches

  NetBox Operator encompasses two distinct but complementary approaches to network operations automation:

  ### AI-Powered Operations Platform
  An intelligent operations platform that leverages artificial intelligence to transform how network teams monitor, troubleshoot, and manage infrastructure.

  ### Kubernetes-Native Management
  A Kubernetes operator that simplifies the deployment, management, and scaling of NetBox instances in containerized environments.

  ## Key Capabilities

  ### üîç Semantic Awareness
  Operator leverages NetBox to understand your infrastructure, accelerating agent workflows and enabling precise, efficient operations.

  ### ‚ö° 10√ó Faster Resolution
  Slash MTTR & MTTD with Operator's autonomous triage, enrichment, and guided remediation.

  ### üéØ Eliminate Toil
  Operator navigates your operations tools to present actionable information - focus on decisions, not data gathering.

  ### üöÄ Kubernetes-Native Deployment
  - **Automated Deployment**: One-click NetBox deployment in Kubernetes clusters
  - **Lifecycle Management**: Automated updates, backups, and maintenance
  - **Scaling & High Availability**: Built-in support for horizontal scaling and failover
  - **GitOps Integration**: Configuration management through Git workflows
  - **Monitoring & Observability**: Integrated metrics and health monitoring

  ## How It Works

  ### NetBox‚Äënative Semantic Map
  No other platform has the depth of context native to NetBox Operator. Your NetBox instance becomes the foundation for AI-powered operations.

  ### Nitro AI Integration
  NetBox Labs' AI platform supercharges Operator with agents, context management, and powerful suite of AI tools.

  ### Ecosystem Integration
  Works with your stack. Operator's agents use the same tools you do to investigate issues and build understanding - all guided by NetBox.

  ## Who Benefits

  ### Network and Infrastructure Engineers
  - Quickly gather the context you need to identify, understand, and resolve issues
  - Reclaim hours per shift and focus on design, not dashboards
  - Accelerate operational workflows with AI assistance
  - Streamlined NetBox deployment and management in Kubernetes

  ### Operations Leaders
  - Eliminate alert fatigue
  - Empower your engineers with AI-powered tools
  - Remediate issues 5-10√ó faster
  - Unleash teams to do their best work

  ### Platform Teams
  - Simplified NetBox lifecycle management
  - Automated scaling and high availability
  - GitOps-ready infrastructure management
  - Integrated monitoring and observability

  ### Consulting Partners
  - Accelerate AI Ops initiatives in tandem with automation, observability, and security
  - Give clients the path to AI driven network and infrastructure operations

  ## Always Operating
  Constant audits, immediate investigations, proactive analysis ‚Äì NetBox Operator is always helping with proactive operations.

  ## Design Partner Program

  NetBox Operator is in active development, and we're seeking forward‚Äëthinking design partners to shape the roadmap and supercharge their operations before general availability.

  ### Benefits of Being a Design Partner
  - Early access to AI‚Äëpowered workflows
  - Direct input on feature development
  - Collaborate with NetBox Labs engineering team
  - Shape the future of AI‚Äëpowered infrastructure operations

  ## FAQ

  ### What is NetBox Operator?
  An AI‚Äëdriven network & infrastructure operations platform that combines NetBox's semantic model with your telemetry tools to automate monitoring, triage, and remediation. It
  also includes Kubernetes-native capabilities for simplified NetBox deployment and management.

  ### Who should engage now?
  Engineering & operations teams eager to collaborate as design partners, provide real‚Äëworld feedback, and gain early access to AI‚Äëpowered workflows with NetBox Operator.

  ### Does it replace my existing NMS or AIOps tool?
  Operator complements your stack ‚Äì adding semantic reasoning, correlation, and automated action on top of traditional monitoring and ML analytics.

  ### What differentiates it from ML‚Äëcentric AIOps platforms?
  Traditional AIOps stops at detecting anomalies; Operator's agentic AI reasons over those anomalies, ties them to topology & intent, and drives approved remediation ‚Äì closing
  the loop.

  ### What tools can it integrate with?
  Out‚Äëof‚Äëthe‚Äëbox connectors for Prometheus, Splunk, Grafana, Zabbix, Elastic, and more; an open SDK lets you add others.

  ### Is NetBox required?
  Yes ‚Äì Operator relies on NetBox (Community, Cloud, or Enterprise) to supply its deep semantic context. NetBox Cloud or NetBox Enterprise will be required when NetBox Operator
  becomes generally available.

  ### How is data handled?
  No customer data trains shared LLMs. During our design partner program, only cloud based deployments of NetBox Operator using our cloud based Nitro AI model providers will be
  supported. When NetBox Operator becomes generally available we expect to support self-hosted LLMs in some use cases.

  ### When will it be generally available?
  NetBox Operator is currently in development. No specific date is set for GA; design‚Äëpartner input will shape final timing and feature set.
