# NetBox Operator

!!! info "**Coming Soon: AI Superpowers for Every Network Engineer**"
    NetBox Operator is currently in active development with design partners. [Become a design partner](https://netboxlabs.com/products/netbox-operator/#faq) to shape the roadmap and gain early access to AI-powered workflows.

NetBox Operator is an AI-driven network and infrastructure operations platform that unleashes agentic AI operations in your infrastructure with NetBox as the semantic map. It continuously watches, correlates, and acts – delivering always-on insight, lightning-fast incident triage, and automated workflows that eliminate operator toil.

## What Makes NetBox Operator Different

NetBox Operator understands your network through NetBox's rich semantic context, enabling it to move beyond traditional monitoring and ML analytics to provide intelligent, contextual automation that closes the operational loop.

### Semantic Awareness
Operator leverages NetBox to understand your infrastructure topology, relationships, and intent – accelerating agent workflows and enabling precise, efficient operations that go far beyond simple anomaly detection.

### 10× Faster Resolution
Slash Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) and Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) with Operator's autonomous triage, enrichment, and guided remediation workflows.

### Eliminate Toil
Operator navigates your operations tools to present actionable information – focus on strategic decisions, not data gathering and manual correlation.

## How It Works

NetBox Operator combines three key components to deliver agentic AI operations:

### 1. NetBox-Native Semantic Map
No other platform has the depth of context native to NetBox Operator. NetBox already functions as a source of truth for devices, circuits, IPs, racks, and other infrastructure, along with the relationships that bind them. In semantic AI terms, that's an **ontology** – a structured representation of entities plus the ways they connect.

This semantic map gives AI agents two superpowers:
- **Instant Orientation**: Instead of guessing what "10.20.30.40" might be, the agent can resolve it to *the* interface, *the* device, *the* circuit, *the* site
- **Guided Reasoning**: Knowing relationships lets the agent ask smarter questions ("What else shares this circuit?") and skip dead ends

### 2. Nitro AI Platform
NetBox Labs' AI platform powers Operator with advanced agents, context management, and a comprehensive suite of AI tools designed specifically for network and infrastructure operations.

### 3. Ecosystem Integration
Works seamlessly with your existing stack. Operator's agents use the same tools you do to investigate issues and build understanding – all guided by NetBox's semantic context.

**Out-of-the-box connectors include:**
- Prometheus
- Splunk  
- Grafana
- Zabbix
- Elastic
- Open SDK for custom integrations

## Agentic AI in Action

### Context Gathering Agent
When an alert arrives, Operator's Context Gathering Agent immediately:

1. **Resolves the Alert**: Transforms raw data (like "10.20.30.40 packet loss >80%") into rich, topology-aware context
2. **Maps Relationships**: Identifies connected devices, circuits, and dependencies
3. **Gathers History**: Reviews recent changes and modifications
4. **Builds Dossier**: Creates comprehensive context for investigation

### Investigation Agent  
Armed with semantic context, the Investigation Agent:

1. **Targets Telemetry**: Makes precise queries to monitoring systems based on NetBox relationships
2. **Correlates Evidence**: Combines data from multiple sources with topology awareness
3. **Identifies Root Cause**: Provides confident analysis with supporting evidence
4. **Recommends Actions**: Suggests specific remediation steps based on infrastructure knowledge

### Example: IP-Triggered Alert Resolution
```
Alert: "STATUS CRITICAL: >80% packet loss for 10.20.30.40 (Akron site)"

Context Agent discovers:
- IP belongs to GigabitEthernet0/0/0 on dmi01-akron-rtr01
- Interface connects to Level 3 MPLS circuit KKDG4923
- Recent ACL changes detected 3 hours ago

Investigation Agent determines:
- Likely cause: Degraded Level 3 MPLS circuit
- Confidence: 90%
- Impact: All DM-Akron traffic using primary MPLS path
- Actions: Shift to secondary circuit, open provider ticket, schedule inspection
```

## Who Benefits

### Network and Infrastructure Engineers
- Quickly gather context needed to identify, understand, and resolve issues
- Reclaim hours per shift and focus on design, not dashboards
- Reduce manual correlation and investigation time

### Operations Leaders
- Eliminate alert fatigue and accelerate operational workflows
- Empower engineering teams to focus on strategic work
- Remediate issues 5-10× faster with intelligent automation

### Consulting Partners
- Accelerate AI Ops initiatives alongside automation, observability, and security projects
- Provide clients with a clear path to AI-driven network and infrastructure operations
- Differentiate services with cutting-edge operational intelligence

## Key Capabilities

### Always-On Operations
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Constant audits, immediate investigations, proactive analysis
- **Continuous Correlation**: Real-time relationship mapping and impact analysis
- **Intelligent Alerting**: Context-aware notifications that cut through noise

### Intelligent Automation
- **Semantic Reasoning**: AI that understands your infrastructure topology and intent
- **Guided Remediation**: Step-by-step resolution workflows based on proven practices
- **Closed-Loop Operations**: Automated actions with approval workflows and rollback capabilities

### Operational Intelligence
- **Topology-Aware Analysis**: Investigations that understand infrastructure relationships
- **Historical Context**: Learning from past incidents and changes
- **Predictive Insights**: Proactive identification of potential issues

## Integration Requirements

### NetBox Dependency
NetBox Operator requires NetBox (Community, Cloud, or Enterprise) to supply its deep semantic context. **NetBox Cloud or NetBox Enterprise will be required when NetBox Operator becomes generally available.**

### Deployment Options
During the design partner program, only cloud-based deployments using NetBox Labs' cloud-based Nitro AI model providers are supported. When generally available, self-hosted LLM support is expected for some use cases.

### Data Handling
- No customer data trains shared LLMs
- Secure, encrypted communication between all components
- Compliance with enterprise security and privacy requirements

## Design Partner Program

NetBox Operator is actively seeking forward-thinking design partners to shape the roadmap and supercharge their operations before general availability.

### Who Should Engage
Engineering and operations teams eager to:
- Collaborate as design partners providing real-world feedback
- Gain early access to AI-powered workflows
- Shape the future of AI-driven infrastructure operations

### Program Benefits
- Early access to NetBox Operator capabilities
- Direct input on feature development and roadmap
- Priority support and training

## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is NetBox Operator?
An AI-driven network & infrastructure operations platform that combines NetBox's semantic model with your telemetry tools to automate monitoring, triage, and remediation.

### Does it replace my existing NMS or AIOps tool?
Operator complements your stack – adding semantic reasoning, correlation, and automated action on top of traditional monitoring and ML analytics.

### What differentiates it from ML-centric AIOps platforms?
Traditional AIOps stops at detecting anomalies; Operator's agentic AI reasons over those anomalies, ties them to topology & intent, and drives approved remediation – closing the loop.

### When will it be generally available?
No specific date is set for general availability; design-partner input will shape final timing and feature set.

### How is data handled?
No customer data trains shared LLMs. During the design partner program, only cloud-based deployments are supported. Self-hosted LLM support is expected for some use cases at general availability.
