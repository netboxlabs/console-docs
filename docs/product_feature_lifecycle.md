## Full Definitions

### Experimental
This stage is for internal testing within the company. Products or features under this category are in their initial development phases, with high risks associated due to unknown variables. They are not supported and documentation is typically limited to code comments, aiming to gather preliminary insights and feedback internally.

### Private Preview
At this stage, products or features are shared with a select group of invited customers. This allows for more focused feedback and testing under real-world conditions, albeit with a medium-high risk. Support is limited and direct through product and engineering teams, with documentation being unofficial and primarily communicated directly with the participants.

### Public Preview
During the Public Preview, products or features are made available to early adopters and users who specifically request access. This phase aims to broaden the feedback loop and iron out any remaining issues, presenting a low to medium risk. Support is available but generally limited to enablement and configuration advice, with documentation becoming more accessible but still considered limited.

### General Availability
Once a product or feature reaches General Availability, it is available to all customers at the appropriate tier, marking its full release. The risk associated with using these products or features is low, as they are considered stable and reliable. Full support is provided at this stage, and documentation is comprehensive and publicly available.
