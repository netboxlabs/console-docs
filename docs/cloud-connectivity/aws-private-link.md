# AWS Private Link (Single Region)

Delivery via [Private Link](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) between a customer's existing AWS account and the NetBox Labs AWS account, with VPC endpoints using private IPs. This option has fast turn-up times and standard Internet delivery can optionally be disabled.
