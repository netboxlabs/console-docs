# Getting Started With NetBox Cloud

This document will help you get up and running with NetBox Cloud quickly. It highlights all the unique features provided by NetBox Cloud.

## About NetBox Cloud
NetBox Cloud is a managed deployment of the open source NetBox application, extended to improve user experience and maintained by NetBox Labs. NetBox Cloud provides all the power of NetBox without the burden of installation and long-term maintenance.

## NetBox Cloud Features
All the NetBox Cloud features within the user interface (UI) are found under the "Cloud" heading of the navigation menu:

## NetBox Configuration
NetBox supports many configuration parameters that affect how it functions. There are two areas of the UI in which these parameters can be adjusted.

### Administrative Configuration
The first area is under the administrative interface. To access this interface, you must be logged into NetBox as a user with administrator privileges. Navigate to the admin UI by expanding the user menu at top right and clicking the "Admin" link. Then, navigate to `Extras > Config revisions > Add`.

![add config revision](../images/getting_started/add_config_revision.png) 

This form will allow you to set various configuration parameters. Once the desired configurations have been made, you may optionally provide a comment as to why the changes were made, and click the "Save" button. This will create a new revision of NetBox's configuration.

Configuration changes made via the admin UI take effect immediately. If you would like to revert your changes at any point, you can do so within the admin UI by locating the desired previous revision and clicking the "Restore" button to its right.

### NetBox Cloud Configuration
You may notice that some configuration parameters are not present from the configuration form in the admin UI. This is because these are not supported by NetBox as dynamic configuration parameters: They can be modified only by altering NetBox's configuration file. Such settings include:
- User authentication (including SSO)
- Enabling & configuring plugins
- Time & date formatting

NetBox Cloud exposes these configuration parameters through its own interface, which can be reached by navigating to `Cloud > Administration > Configuration`.

Once the desired configuration parameters have been set, click the "Save & Restart" button. Note that the application of these changes does require a restart of some NetBox Cloud services, and access to the NetBox Cloud UI and API may be interrupted briefly.

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
NetBox Cloud currently supports single sign-on (SSO) authentication for the following providers:

- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure Active Directory)
- Okta (via OpenID Connect)

We are implementing support for additional backends as customers request them. If you have a need for a specific authentication backend, please let us know.

To enable SSO, select the desired backend and provide the required configuration parameters under the appropriate tab. For information on configuring your specific backend service, you can consult the [SSO configuration guides](https://docs.netbox.dev/en/stable/administration/authentication/overview/) in the NetBox documentation, or contact NetBox Labs for assistance.
